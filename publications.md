# Publications

***Note on citing***:
*By default, Bibtex will butcher last names with spaces (turning Claire into Goues,
C.L. or Rijnard into Tonder, R.V.); we always appreciate judiciously applied brackets (`{Le Goues}`) or a
non-breaking space (`van~Tonder`). We have found that a combination of the two
(`{Le~Goues}`) seems to work best.*
