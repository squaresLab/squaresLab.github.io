# Publications

***Note on citing***:
*By default, Bibtex will butcher Claire's last name (turning her into Goues,
C.L.); we always appreciate judiciously applied brackets (`{Le Goues}`) or a
non-breaking space (`Le~Goues`). We have found that a combination of the two
(`{Le~Goues}`) seems to work best.*
