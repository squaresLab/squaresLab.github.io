## Adding your paper to the squaresLab site

Adding your paper is now easy! Just drop a BibTeX entry in
`_bibliography/publications.bib` and Travis will take care of the rest. The
BibTeX entry can contain several meta-fields to automatically generate other
types of links:

- `pdf`: If you'd like to add a link to a PDF, just drop a copy in the `papers`
  directory and put the filename in this field.
