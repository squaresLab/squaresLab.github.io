# We Care About Software Quality

squaresLab, at <a href="https://http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon's
School of Computer Science</a>, focuses on Software QUality in Real Evolving
Systems*. We do research in automated techniques to reason about, assure,
measure and then improve the quality of real, messy, ever-changing
software.

squaresLab@CMU is led by (Assistant) Professor [Claire Le Goues](http://www.clairelegoues.com), and also includes:

*   [Chris Timperley](http://www.christimperley.co.uk), post-doc extraordinaire
*   [Deby Katz](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dskatz/)
*   [Zack Coker](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/zfc/)
*   Rijnard van Tonder
*   [Mauricio Soto](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msotogon/)
