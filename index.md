# Welcome to squaresLab@CMU*

<p>squaresLab is led by (Assistant) Professor <a
href="http://www.clairelegoues.com">Claire Le Goues</a> at Carnegie Mellon's
School of Computer Science.  We care about Software QUality in Real Evolving
Systems**. We do research in automated techniques to reason about, assure,
measure and then improve the quality of real, messy, ever-changing
software. </p>

<p>*Unofficial Motto: "it's funny, because we're not!"</p>
<p>**We apologize, sort of, for the egregious backronym.</p>
