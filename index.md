## We Care About Software Quality

**squaresLab**, at [Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer
Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), focuses on **S**oftware **QUA**lity in
**R**eal **E**volving **S**ystems.* We do research in automated techniques to
reason about, assure, measure and then improve the quality of real, messy,
ever-changing software.
